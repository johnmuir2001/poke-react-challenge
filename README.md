## Pok√©mon API to compare the characters stats

I worked with Mike to fix the issues with the app

We forked a repository and had 7 issues to solve.

The issues included:
  - Limiting the amount of character cards visible,
  - Sorting out the CSS
  - Alphabetise the character names
  - Scroll through the characters 
  - Capatalise the Names
  - Add a predictive search bar
  - The Names pop up when the search bar is active

Then once they were fixed we added features that we thought were appropriate for the app:
  - Compasrison between stats
  - Scroll with the arrows on keyboard
  - No button but you click on a name to add its card
