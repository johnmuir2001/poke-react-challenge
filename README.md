## Pok√©mon API to compare the characters stats

I worked with Mike to fix the issues with the app

We forked a repository and had 7 issues to solve.

The issues included:
  Limiting the amount of character cards visible
  Sorting out the CSS
  Alphabetise the character names
  Capatalise the Names
  Add a predictive search bar

Then once they were fixed we added features that we thought were appropriate for the app.
